# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is, like it sounds; a Tic-Tac-Toe game. Also known as Noughts and Crosses. It is part of Harvard's CS50 Intro to Artificial Intelligence Course.
It is an AI that you can play Tic-Tac-Toe against, although it is probably not a particularly fun game since you cannot beat it. It plays optimally leading to a win for the "computer" player or a tie.

It uses a Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
